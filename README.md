# Simple TelnetServer C#

This is a simple Telnet server that I created that is RFC854 compliant (needs some work)
I created this because I could not find any decent Telnet Server sources out there usally only bits and peices that did not work
as I would like.
Currently I use it as a simple command line interface for my applications (a bit quicker that a web interface)

Warning - the telnet protocol sends all data over the wire in clear text the protocal is NOT secure

No it isn't RFC854 compliant. (will soon be)
